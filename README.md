Working Environment: https://ksbunk-calculator.herokuapp.com/

The application calculates the sum of any number of measurments of compatible types (mass, volume or distance). The units themselves are extensible and stored in a database. Validation and calculation is performed server side.

The result is returned in a combination of value and unit. The value is allways returned in the largest unit selected.
